							<p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bolder;">IELTS Introduction</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">The International English Language Testing System (IELTS) measures the language proficiency of people who want to study or work where English is used as a language of communication. It uses a nine-band scale to clearly identify levels of proficiency, from non-user (band score 1) through to expert (band score 9).</p>
							<p style="font-size: 18px;">IELTS Academic or IELTS General Training
IELTS is available in two test versions: Academic – for people applying for higher education or professional registration, and General Training for those migrating to Australia, Canada and the UK, or applying for secondary education, training programmes and work experience in an English-speaking environment. Both versions provide a valid and accurate assessment of the four language skills: listening, reading, writing and speaking.</p>
